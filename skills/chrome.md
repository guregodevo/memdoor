# Chrome (reading pages that need a real browser, with the chrome CLI)

To SEARCH the web, call the web_search tool: it returns the answer with its
sources. Search engines answer a headless browser with a bot challenge, so a
search through Chrome does not work. To read a page, call web_fetch.

Use this skill when web_fetch can't render a page (JavaScript-heavy sites) or
you must click or type on it. You drive a real Chrome through the bash tool
with a tiny script DSL:

    echo 'nav <url>
    wait 2
    exec document.body.innerText' | memdoor chrome run | head -80

Verbs: nav <url> · wait <seconds> · exec <js> · click <selector> ·
click-text <text> · type <selector> <text> · press <key> · snap <file.png>

`exec` takes an expression (`document.title`) or a function
(`() => [...document.querySelectorAll('a')].map(a => a.href)`).

## Rules

- ALWAYS pipe the output through `head` (60-80 lines) — a full page dump buries
  the answer.
- For API documentation, prefer the LOCAL lookups first (go doc,
  python3 -m pydoc, node -e) — the web is for what the machine doesn't have.
- If the page shows a challenge ("confirm you are human", a CAPTCHA), stop:
  say so, and use web_search or another source. Never try to solve it.
- Quote what you actually read; if the page didn't load (empty output), say so —
  never invent search results.
