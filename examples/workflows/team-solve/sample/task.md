# Problem: Longest Balanced Substring Count

You are given a string S of length N (1 ≤ N ≤ 200000) over the alphabet {a, b, c}.
A substring is *balanced* if it contains the same number of 'a', 'b' and 'c'
(all three counts equal, possibly zero only for the empty substring, which does not count).

Print the number of non-empty balanced substrings of S.

## Input
A single line with the string S.

## Output
One integer: the number of balanced substrings.

## Constraints
N up to 200000, so the solution must run in O(N) or O(N log N) time.

## Examples
Input: abc       → Output: 1      (the whole string)
Input: abcabc    → Output: 5      (abc, bca, cab, abc, and abcabc itself)
Input: aabbcc    → Output: 1      (the whole string)
Input: aaa       → Output: 0

Write the program as solution.py reading stdin and printing the answer.
